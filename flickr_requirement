Write a mobile app that uses the Flickr image search API and shows the results in a 3-column scrollable view.

Requirements:

The app must support endless scrolling, automatically requesting and displaying more images when the user scrolls to the bottom of the view.
The app must allow you to see a history of past searches, by using SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider for example.
The app should correctly handle orientation changes (without requiring android:configChanges in your manifest) and should work correctly with the “Don’t Keep Activities” developer option enabled.
We encourage you to use Android Studio and Gradle. If you choose to use something else, please provide detailed instructions of how to build your application.
Don’t worry about supporting old versions of Android, a minSdkVersion of 15 or later is completely fine. Bonus points for material design.
Feel free to use whatever technologies you're the most comfortable with. This includes any sort of open-source third-party frameworks. We encourage you to use open-source libraries like Butterknife, Gson, OkHttp, Otto, Picasso, Retrofit, RxJava, Volley, etc.
Your priorities should be:

A working app. Shortcuts are fine given the time constraints, but be prepared to justify them and explain better solutions you would have implemented with more time.
Clean code and architecture. We’d like you to write production ready code that you would be proud to submit as an open source project.
We expect this to take a maximum of 4 hours so no need to implement features that would obviously require more time than that. A concise and readable codebase that accomplishes all of the above requirements is the goal, so don’t try to do any more than is required to solve the problem cleanly.

Include both a pre-built APK and complete source code in your submission. Please exclude all auto-generated files and build output from the source archive.

Good luck!

Flickr API

You can make this call to the Flickr API to return a JSON object with a list of photos.

https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.photos.search&api_key=3e7cc266ae2b0e0d78e279ce8e361736&format=json&nojsoncallback=1&text=kittens
The text parameter should be replaced with the query that the user enters into the app.

The JSON response you'll receive will have items described like this example.

{
    "id": "23451156376",
    "owner": "28017113@N08",
    "secret": "8983a8ebc7",
    "server": "578",
    "farm": 1,
    "title": "Merry Christmas!",
    "ispublic": 1,
    "isfriend": 0,
    "isfamily": 0
},
You can use these parameters to get the full URL of the photo:

http://farm{farm}.static.flickr.com/{server}/{id}_{secret}.jpg
So, using our example from before, the URL would be

http://farm1.static.flickr.com/578/23451156376_8983a8ebc7.jpg
If interested, more documentation about the search endpoint can be found at https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.search. If you have any problems with the Uber-specified API key, then you can generate your own at https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html.
